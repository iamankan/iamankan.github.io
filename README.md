### About

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. I enjoy doing research in Computer Science, specifically in the field of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning. I am interested in the application of these techniques to Digital Humanities. I am excited to discover new contents from damaged antique artifacts, which no one has ever been able to see. Specifically, I work on non invasive digital restoration of old damaged photographic films, under the supervision of [Dr. Brent Seales](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/w-brent-seales) and [Dr. Seth Parker]([https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/w-brent-seales](https://csparker247.github.io/)), in [EduceLab](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/directory). I have more than 2 years experience in CT Scanning and 3D prinitng mounts for artifacts like scrolls, books, and films on SKYSCAN 1273. I have about a decade of experience in applying deep learning based Computer Vision models to data like online handwriting, Infrared images and X-Ray based CT Scans. I am interested in exploring Ray Tracing based techniques to Computer Vision problems. I am passionate about the intersection between Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. I am also experienced in using Camera systems like FLIR cameras and building software using Spinnaeker library provided by Teledyne. I am interested in understanding how a data is collected and what the data means before applying any machine learning/ deep learning models. I am more keen towards understanding the data at a material level and figure out how an EM wave like X-Ray or visible light interacted with the materials to make that data/image. This helps me building a deep learning model to understand the property of the material rather than applying out-of-the-box model as a black box.
