### About

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. I am also a Research Assistant at the [EduceLab](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/directory) under the supervision of [Dr. Brent Seales](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/w-brent-seales). I enjoy doing research in Computer Science, specifically in the field of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning. I am interested in the application of these techniques to Digital Humanities. I am excited to discover new contents from damaged antique artifacts, which no one has ever been able to see.
